\chapter{结论}

Traditional PCA-based anomaly detection models are not suitable for anomaly interpretation, limiting its usage in the domains where interpretation is essential.  In this paper, we found that the sparsity and orthogonality of the loading vectors are the keys to anomaly interpretation, and proposed an interpretable PCA-based anomaly detection model, the ASPCA model. We designed \emph{forward} and \emph{backward} ASPCA models and evaluated them on two real world datasets. Our model achieved similar or even better anomaly detection performance as the traditional PCA model, and provided meaningful interpretation for individual anomalies. Our future works will focus on three directions: 1) how to improve efficiency on high dimensional datasets; 2) how to extend our model to robust PCA for better detection performance; 3) how to extend our model to kernel PCA.
